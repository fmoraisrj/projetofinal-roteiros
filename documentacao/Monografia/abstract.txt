The project “Viajantes” aims to explore the power and flexibility of collaborative social networks to provide information about tourist sights, establishments, events, and others. The purpose of the proposed tool is the dissemination and sharing of these experiences with other people interested, allowing the choice of new trips, by that time unknown, and the gathering of data  on establishments and tourist sights little explored by some magazines and available guides. In the “Viajantes” the user will plan travel road maps setting the planned cost, besides giving tips and evaluating establishments, events and tourist sights already visited. The software was built on the Rails framework, which provides a range of facilities for the development of web applications, making the process more enjoyable and productive.
